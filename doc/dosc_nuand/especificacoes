The hardware consists of:

	-> Si5338 clock generator for arbitrary sample rate generation
	-> Lime Microsystems LMS6002D
	-> Altera Cyclone IV E (40kLE or 115kLE) FPGA for signal processing and control
	-> Cypress FX3 USB 3.0 Superspeed Microcontroller

Cypress FX3
	The FX3 firmware basically has 3 separate modes of operation:

	-> FPGA Loading
	-> RF Link
	-> SPI flashing
	-> The reason for the changes in the operating modes is due to having to
	reconfigure the GPIF. This design choice was made to alleviate the need for a 
	very complex GPIF state machine in favor of more complexity on the host side 
	software.

Altera Cyclone IV E FPGA
	Software in the FPGA consists of two major pieces:

	-> Hardware Description Language (HDL) for the logic/signal processing
	C code in a NIOS II processor for control of the LMS6002D, VCTCXO trim DAC and 
	Si5338 PLL

Power-Consumption
		->The DC barrel jack on the bladeRF requires a 5 V adapter, which should be 
		rated to supply at least 1.5 A. Many supplies will experience significant 
		voltage droop as the current draw approaches as little as 50% of the rated 
		maximum. 

		If the voltage droops too low, it will degrade the performance of the
    bladeRF.
		Voltage: 5 V
		Current: 1.5 - 3 A
		Plug inner diameter: 2.5 mm (V+)
		Plug outer diameter: 5.5 mm (GND)
		Over-voltage, over-current, short-circuit protection: recommended
